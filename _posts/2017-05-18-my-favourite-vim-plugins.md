My Favourite Vim Plugins
========================

Vim gains much power through the inclusion of *plugins*. However, the sheer
number of available plugins can be overwhelming for novice Vim users.

This post contains a curated set of my favourite Vim *plugins*.

vim-plug
--------
The first decision a Vim user, looking to enter the plugin world, must decide
is which plugin manager to use. There are many to choose from: *Vundle*,
*Pathogen*, *vim-plug*, *Dein* to name but a few.

Each will do the job, but for *simplicity* and *maximum performance* the
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager is hard to
beat. It is was I recommend.

Use **:PlugUpdate** to update your plugins and **:PlugUpgrade** to upgrade
*vim-plug* itself.

If you are a *Vundle* user (like I was), transfering over to *vim-plug* is
simple, just follow [this](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) advice.

vim-moonfly-colors
------------------
Some self advertising. I have written my own *colorscheme*
[moonfly](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors).

*moonfly* is a, yet another, dark theme, but unlike all other dark themes this
one is **my** dark theme. That means it has been tuned to my particular tastes.
Whether those tastes match up with your tastes will be in the eye of the
beholder.

vim-moonfly-statusline
----------------------
Personally I am not a fan of heavy *statusline* plugins like: *powerline* and
*airline*. I have written a simple matching *statusline* for the
[moonfly](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors) colorscheme,
[moonfly-statusline](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-statusline). It is
lightweight yet clearly indicates when you are in: normal, insert, replace or
visual modes.
