Computing Security Tips
=======================

Being secure in this fast moving and ever changing digital world can be a
challenge. Security is usually the last thing folks want to deal with, bad
stuff won't happen to me, right?

You lock your doors for a reason, that same logic applies to the digital world.
There are many bad actors out there: nation-states, cybercriminals,
hackers all the way throught to
[script kiddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie) and
[wardrivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving).

This is a guide of my simple tips that most ordinary folks should be able to
follow to improve their digital security.

Keep Up To Date
===============

**The** most important policy to enhance your digital security is to keep all
software and hardware up to date. Security flaws are constantly being
discovered and fixed.

Critical software such as computer operating systems, browsers and apps by and
large now automatically update. Please, never turn off these automatic updates.

Talk about smartphones.

Hardware, such as routers, on the otherhand usually do not update themselves.
It is equally important that these devices are updated occasionally; a good
rule is to update seasonally.

Password Policy
===============

Computers are getting faster and so is the ability for cybercriminals and
hackers to crack password. Most folks have poor password hygiene; passwords too
weak in combination with password reuse.

A six character password can be cracked in seconds on a modern password
cracking machine. Seven characters is also weak, same for eight and nine.

My recommendation, passwords should be at least twelve characters, preferably
more. Use phrases to gain complexity, for instance
*boatsWillFloatPlanesWillGlide669!* is a **far** stronger password than
*ghU89!ghkQwl$* and is a heck of a lot easier to remember.

The need to remember passwords results in users reusing passwords. This is
dangerous. It is strongly recommended to use unique passwords per context; you
laptop login password should differ from your Google password which should also
differ from your Facebook password and so on.

How to remember all these passwords?

Use a password manager, only one password to remember. I prefer offline
password managers such as [KeePass](https://keepass.info) and its derivatives
such as [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org). These, compatible, password managers store
your passwords in an encrypted database protected by one master
password. Please choose a very strong password for the master. Also, keep a
copy of the KeePass database, usually `Database.kdb`, safely stored offsite, I
recommend a CD-R stored in a safety deposit box.

Avoid Phishing Scams
====================

[Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing), as noted at Wikipedia, is
the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and
credit card details (and, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by
disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.

The common form is unsolicited email disguised as being from a legitimate
entity. For example it may be an email styled to look like it came from *PayPal*
with a link to a fake PayPal site designed to fool the victim into typing in
their username and password.

To protect yourself from such scams please be sceptical of any unsolicited
correspondence, either in email or messaging form. Do *NOT* click links, do
*NOT* open attachments. Do not be tricked into sending your password in
electronic form.

Always log in to the official portal of a service provider, such as a bank or
ecommerce vender, via a bookmark. Never click a link in a message claiming to
be an entity.

Avoid Social Engineering Scams
==============================

[Social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)),
as noted at Wikipedia, refers to psychological manipulation of people into
performing actions or divulging confidential information.

The common form of information technology social engineering would be
unsolicited phone calls from entities claiming to be official entites (for
example a bank, or a telecommunications provider) that requires your personal
details to solve an issue.

To protect yourself from these scams please never provide your confidential
details to anyone. No one but you should know your confidential credentials.
Real banks will never ring you asking for your password.

Keep your passwords confidential always.
