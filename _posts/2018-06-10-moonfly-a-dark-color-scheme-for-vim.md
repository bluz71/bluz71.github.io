moonfly - A dark color scheme for Vim
=====================================

It is now just on a year since the first public release of the
[moonfly](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors) color scheme for Vim.

Happy birthday :tada: :tada:

Yes, there are numerous color schemes already, apologies for creating one
more :wink:

History
-------

The moonfly color scheme in actuality dates back to early 2014 and was
initially inspired by the [Monokai](https://atom.io/themes/monokai) theme as
then used by default in the [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com) text editor.

I liked Monokai, but I wanted a theme with a darker background along with less
vivid colors. Also, soon after the [Atom](https://atom.io) editor hit the scene
with its nice [One Dark Syntax](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) theme.

These existing themes, along with
[others](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors#moonfly), provided the
basis to combine into a single palette the colors and choices that pleased my
eye the most, along with a few color tweaks here and there.

The moonfly color scheme is indeed somewhat of a rogue :smiling_imp:

Name
----

The *moonfly* name was motivated by the ridiculous names the
[NSA](https://www.nsa.gov) uses for its covert surveillance programs, such as:
*egotistical giraffe*, *fox acid*, *cult weave* and *eggs mayhem* to name a
few.

Note, due to compression, the above images are not an exact representation,
they are a dimmer than the actual color scheme.

Details
-------

When used in command-line Vim, a 256-color terminal will be required. This
color scheme also supports the newer `termguicolors` true color option
available in modern versions of Vim and Neovim.

A number of
[languages](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors#languages-explicitly-styled)
and Vim
[plugins](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors#plugins-explicity-styled)
are supported.

Installation details are provided
[here](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors#installation).

The moonfly color scheme is completely free,
[MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) licensed.

Alternatives
------------

The [vim-one](https://github.com/rakr/vim-one) color scheme is a light and dark
theme derived from Atom's One Dark Syntax theme.

The [Nova](https://github.com/trevordmiller/nova-vim) color sheme is a flat
pastel theme that is designed to be easy on the eye.

Both are superb themes.
