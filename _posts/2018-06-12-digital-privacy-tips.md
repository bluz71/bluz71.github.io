Digital Privacy Tips
====================

We now live in a age where everyone in the digital world is being surveilled,
profiled and targetted. That may be at a nation-state level, such as by the
American [NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency) and
British
[GCHQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters)
with their mass-surveillance systems, or it may be at a private enterprise
level, such as by the internet giants Google and Facebooks with their
targetting advertising systems.

Digital privacy is the right to protect your personal information from:
unpermitted collection, unpermitted use, and unpermitted distribution to third
parties.

This guide contains tips and suggestions that readers can use to increase their
privacy in the digital domain.

Note, if you are genuine target of a nation-state, then realistically there is
little you can do to remain private, but thankfully most citizens do not fall
into that category.

Security
========

Before tackling digital privacy it is **extremely** important that one has a
strong security regime in place. Please read the
[Sensible Computing Security
Tips](http://localhost:4000/2017/11/12/sensible-computing-security-tips.html)
as a starting point to secure you digital devices.

You can not be private unless you are first secure. Please keep up-to-date,
enable disk encryption, use strong passwords and don't be a victim of phishing
and social engineering.

ISP Snooping
============

The first place your digital privacy will likely not be respected is through
your internet service provider (ISP).

Depending in which country you live in, and possibly which provider you use,
your internet activity will be logged. That may include the following
[metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata): which sites you visit,
who you communicate with, at what time, and for how long to name a few.

That information may be provided to intelligence agencies to feed their
mass-survallience systems, or the ISP may sell it to advertisers to target ads
to you. It is even possible that cyber-criminals could steal that information
for their own nefarious activities.

There are two main technologies that shield you from ISP logging, virtual
private networks (VPNs) and TOR. A VPN creates a private network across a
public network (usually the internet). A well designed VPN creates a secure
encryted tunnel to the internet thus blinding your ISP to your activity. TOR on
the other hand is anonymizing and censorship circumvention system based on a
host of volunteer-operated servers worldwide.

For most citizens I recommend the purchase and usage of a trusted VPN provider.
A trust-worthy VPN will provide protection from ISP snooping and with
far-greater performance than what TOR can provide.

I trust these VPN providers:

Summary
=======

Physical privacy is a right not a privilege, and the same should apply in the
digital domain.

I know some would say, *I have nothing to hide*, to those people I provide the
following quotes.

Benjamin Franklin (one of the Founding Fathers of the United States)

> Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary
> safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.

Joseph Goebbels (Nazi Party)

> If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing fear

Edward Snowden (Whistleblower)

> Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have
> nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech
> because you have nothing to say
