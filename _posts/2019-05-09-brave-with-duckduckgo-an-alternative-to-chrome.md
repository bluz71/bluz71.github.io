Brave with DuckDuckGo, an alternative to Chrome
===============================================

Google is now omnipresent as technology has become an integral part of modern
life.

With 90% of the market Google is dominant in web search whilst
also being dominant in web browsing with Google Chrome having 70% of that
market as of May 2019.

With the ubiquity of Google Chrome and Search, Google has unrivaled power to
individually target you with ads based on your online footprint.

This post will discuss the [Brave browser](https://brave.com) and [DuckDuckGo
search](https://duckduckgo.com) as viable alternatives to Google Chrome and
Google Search. Switching to these products will reduce your Google footprint
whilst also greatly increasing your privacy.

Privacy Issues with Chrome
--------------------------

I must confess, I was a long time user of Chrome, that being from launch in 2008
up until 2018. I liked Chrome, it was fast, usable, and most importantly it was
cross platform.

The inflection point when I soured on Chrome was when Google [merged Google
accounts with Chrome 'Sign in'](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17942252)
in September of 2018. Prior to this change, in Chrome 69, your Goggle login
(Gmail) was separate from your Chrome *Sign in* (for bookmark synchronization
across multiple devices). Post Chrome 69 logging into your Google account, to
read your Gmail for example, would then result in Chrome simultaneously signing
to Google. Presumably once Chrome is *Signed in* Google can track your activity
the web more easily.

It seems I was not the only one upset by this change, Matthew Green wrote an
excellent article that is still worth a read:

Brave Browser
-------------

[Brave](https://brave.com) is a modern, free, open and cross-platform web
browser that is based on the same
[Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src) browser and Blink
engine that powers Google Chrome. 

Brave, unlike Chrome, by default will:

- Block trackers

- Block 3rd party ads

- Block 3rd party cookie

- Upgrade connections to HTTPS where possible

Some of the above capabilities are available as broswer extensions to Chrome
([uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) and [HTTPS
Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) for example), however not all
versions of Chrome support extensions, for example Chrome on Android. Also,
who's to say that some day Google may not block certain extensions?
Incorporating blocking directly into the core browser is a huge win.

The Brave browser is developed by Brave O

Will be very familiar to Chrome users, similar look and feel. It feels like
Chrome because for the most part it is Chrome, just with all the Google specific
bits stripped out.
