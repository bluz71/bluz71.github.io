Brave with DuckDuckGo, an alternative to Chrome
===============================================

It seems as if Google is now omnipresent as technology has become an integral
part of modern life.

And for good reason, with 90% of the market, Google is dominant in web search
whilst also now being dominant in web browsing with Google Chrome having 70% of
the market as of May 2019.

With the ubiquity of the Google Search, Chrome, Android and YouTube suite of
products, Google has unrivaled power to individually target you with ads based
on your online footprint.

For those wishing to reduce their Google footprint, this post will discuss the
[Brave browser](https://brave.com) and [DuckDuckGo
search](https://duckduckgo.com) as viable alternatives to Google Chrome and
Google Search. Not only will switching to these products will reduce your Google footprint
whilst also greatly increasing your privacy.

Automatic Sign-in issue with Chrome
-----------------------------------

I was a long time user of Chrome, that being from launch in 2008 up until 2018.
I liked Chrome, it was fast, secure, extendible, and most importantly
cross-platform.

The inflection point when I soured on Chrome was when [Google accounts where
merged with Chrome sign-in](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17942252) in
Chrome 69. After that change, logging into your Google account, to read your
Gmail for instance, would then result in Chrome simultaneously signing to
Google thus potentially synchronizing with Google some of your activity without
your consent. Also, presumably once Chrome is signed-in Google may track your
activity more easily, either now or in the future.

I was not the only one upset by this particular change, Matthew Green, a
professor at Johns Hopkins University who teaches cryptography, [wrote about
the
issue](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome)
in depth.

Brave Browser
-------------

[Brave](https://brave.com) is a modern, private and secure web browser that is
based on the same [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src)
browser and [Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink) rendering engine that powers
Google Chrome.

The Brave browser is [openly](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser) developed
by [Brave Software](https://github.com/brave) which was co-founded by Brendon
Eich, the creator of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and
co-founder of [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla), the organization
that makes [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox).

Notable privacy and security characteristics of Brave:

- Automatically blocks unwanted content, such as tracking cookies and 3rd-party
  ads

- Automatically protects against
  [fingerprinting](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Fingerprinting-Protection-Mode)

- Where possible, insecure connections will be seamlessly be upgraded to
  encrypted connections for secure communication

- True private browsing mode via the [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) anonymity
  network

Similarities of Brave to Chrome:

- Generally similar look and feel

- Multi-platform support, including all major desktop and mobile platforms

- Cross-platform and cross-device
  [synchronization](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021218111-How-do-I-set-up-Sync-)

- Compatibility with existing Chrome extensions

Notable Brave [deviations from
Chrome](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Deviations-from-Chromium-(features-we-disable-or-remove)):

- Google account synchronization is disabled

- All features that send data to Google are disabled

- Cookie lifetimes are limited to 7 days

Whilst some of the privacy-focussed characteristics of Brave listed above are
available as browser extensions to Chrome, namely [uBlock
Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) and [HTTPS
Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere), be aware that not all
versions of Chrome support extensions, most frustratingly Chrome on mobile
devices. Also, content-filtering extensions, such as uBlock, run the risk of one
day being black-listed by Google. That will never be an issue for Brave since
its security and privacy protections are built-int to the browser itself.

Note, Brave is not the only Chromium-based browser available, other choices
include: [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com), [Opera](https://www.opera.com),
[Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) and even
Microsoft's [Edge browser](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us).
Personally, I favour Brave above all these alternatives due to: open-source
development, timely updates, cross-platform support including Linux and mobile,
native privacy and security features, and lastly cross-device synchronization.

Recommended Brave Settings
--------------------------

Privacy and security can further be enhanced by tweaking Brave's settings.

Brave Desktop settings:

- `Brave Shields default`, `Fingerprintig protection` change to `Block 
  all fingerprinting`

- `Social Buttons and Logins`, disable all options

- `Privacy and security`, enable `Send a "Do not track"` and disable `Allow
  sites to check if you have payment saved`


DuckDuckGo
----------

Conclusion
----------

* No reason anyone should use Chrome over Brave. Brave does everything Chrome
  does whislt doing it more securely and privately whilst being very similar to
  Chrome
