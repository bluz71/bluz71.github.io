Brave with DuckDuckGo, an alternative to Chrome
===============================================

It seems as if Google is now omnipresent as technology has become an integral
part of modern life.

And for good reason, with 90% of the market, Google is dominant in web search
whilst also now being dominant in web browsing with Google Chrome having 70% of
the market as of May 2019.

With the ubiquity of the Google Search, Chrome, Android and YouTube suite of
products, Google has unrivaled power to individually target you with ads based
on your online footprint.

For those wishing to reduce their Google footprint, this post will discuss the
[Brave browser](https://brave.com) and [DuckDuckGo
search](https://duckduckgo.com) products as viable alternatives to Google Chrome
and Google Search. Switching to these products will reduce your Google footprint
whilst also greatly increasing your privacy and security.

Automatic Sign-in issue with Chrome
-----------------------------------

I was a long time user of Chrome, that being from launch in 2008 up until 2018.
I liked Chrome, it was fast, secure, extendible, and most importantly
cross-platform.

The inflection point when I soured on Chrome was when [Google accounts where
merged with Chrome sign-in](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17942252) in
Chrome 69. After that change, logging into your Google account, to read your
Gmail for instance, would then result in Chrome simultaneously signing to Google
thus potentially synchronizing, with Google, some of your activity without your
consent. Also, presumably once Chrome is signed-in Google may track your online
activity more easily, either now or in the future.

I was not the only one upset by this particular change, Matthew Green, a
professor at Johns Hopkins University who teaches cryptography, [wrote about
the
issue](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome)
in depth.

Brave Browser
-------------

[Brave](https://brave.com) is a modern, private and secure web browser that is
based on the same [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src)
browser and [Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink) rendering engine that powers
Google Chrome.

The Brave browser is [openly](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser) developed
by [Brave Software](https://github.com/brave) which was co-founded by Brendon
Eich, the creator of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and
co-founder of [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla), the organization
that makes [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox).

Notable privacy and security characteristics of Brave:

- Automatically blocks unwanted content, such as tracking cookies and 3rd-party
  ads

- Automatically protects against
  [fingerprinting](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Fingerprinting-Protection-Mode)

- Where possible, insecure connections will be seamlessly be upgraded to
  encrypted connections for secure communication

- True private browsing mode via the [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) anonymity
  network

Similarities of Brave to Chrome:

- Generally similar look and feel

- Multi-platform support, including all major desktop and mobile platforms

- Cross-platform and cross-device
  [synchronization](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021218111-How-do-I-set-up-Sync-)

- Compatibility with existing Chrome extensions

Notable Brave [deviations from
Chrome](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Deviations-from-Chromium-(features-we-disable-or-remove)):

- Google account synchronization is disabled

- All features that send data to Google are disabled

- Cookie lifetimes are limited to 7 days

Whilst some of the privacy-focussed characteristics of Brave listed above are
available as browser extensions to Chrome, namely the [uBlock
Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) and [HTTPS
Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) extensions, be aware that not
all versions of Chrome support extensions, most frustratingly Chrome on mobile
devices. Also, content-filtering extensions, such as uBlock, run the risk of one
day being black-listed by Google. That will never be an issue for Brave since
its security and privacy protections are built-in to the browser itself.

Note, Brave is not the only Chromium-based browser available, other choices
include: [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com), [Opera](https://www.opera.com),
[Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) and even
Microsoft's [Edge browser](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us).
Personally, I favour Brave above all these alternatives due to: open
development, timely updates, cross-platform support including desktop and
mobile, native privacy and security features, and cross-device synchronization.

Lastly, Brave has an excellent and easy to understand [privacy
policy](https://brave.com/privacy).

Recommended Brave Settings
--------------------------

Privacy and security can further be enhanced by tweaking Brave's settings at
`brave://settings`.

Brave settings:

- `Search Engine`, `Search engine used in the address bar`, change to
  `DuckDuckGo`

Brave desktop-specific settings:

- `Brave Shields default`, `Fingerprintig protection` change to `Block 
  all fingerprinting`

- `Social Buttons and Logins`, disable all options

- `Privacy and security`, enable `Send a "Do not track"` and disable `Allow
  sites to check if you have payment saved`


DuckDuckGo
----------

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) is a privacy focussed Internet search
engine.

Unlike Google Search, DuckDuckGo will:

- Not log IP addresses

- Not log user searches

- Display the same results, for a given search, to **all** users

- Track your online activity

The quality and relevance of search results for DuckDuckGo has greatly improved
in the last few years, hence, it no longer feels like a compromise to DuckDuckGo
as compared to Google Search.

Much like Brave, DuckDuckGo also has an excellent and easy to understand
[privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy).

DuckDuckGo !Bangs
-----------------

DuckDuckGo Bangs are simple shortcuts to 3rd party search sites. To invoke a
Bang search simply type `!` with the appropriate site code followed by the
search query.

Note, as of May 2019 there are over [12,000 Bangs
available](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) to explore and use.

A few convenient DuckDuckGo Bangs:

- `!g search query`, [Google Search](https://www.google.com)

- `!gi search query`, [Goggle Images](https://images.google.com)

- `!gm search query`, [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)

- `!yt search query`, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)

- `!a search query`, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com)

- `!w search query`, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)

- `!e search query`, [eBay](https://www.ebay.com)

- `!r search query`, [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)

- `!gh search query`, [Github](https://www.github.com)

- `!so search query`, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

- `!t search query`, [Thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com)

- `!d search query`, [The Free Dictionary](https://www.thefreedictionary.com)

- `!rt search query`, [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com)

- `!bang search query` [DuckDuckGo Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang)

Bangs work particularly well in Brave once DuckDuckGo has been configured as the
default Search Engine; simply enter the Bang of choice and search query directly
in the address bar.

DuckDuckGo Bangs making searching the web easy, simple and fast.

DuckDuckGo Tools
----------------

DuckDuckGo provides the following useful tools:

- `shorten http:\\really-long-url`, shorten web links

- `@user_handle`, search social media platforms for a particular user handle

- `calendar`, this months calendar

- `calculator`, simple calculator

- `stopwatch`, simple stopwatch

Conclusion
----------

The Web is now dominated by a few giant companies, chief among them Google. That
market concentration is not healthy, so it behooves us to sensibly diversify
where possible. Thankfully with Brave and DuckDuckGo, as alternatives to Chrome
and Google Search respectively, diversifying will reap dividends, especially
with regards to privacy, and with little to no concession.

The more people that use products like Brave and DuckDuckGo, the healthier the
Web will be. Please give these alternatives a try :beers:
