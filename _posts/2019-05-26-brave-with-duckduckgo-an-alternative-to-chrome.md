Brave with DuckDuckGo, an alternative to Chrome
===============================================

It seems as if Google is omnipresent these days as technology has become an
integral part of modern life.

With 90% of the market Google is dominant in web search whilst also now being
dominant in web browsing with Google Chrome having 70% of the market as of May
2019.

The ubiquity of the Google Search, Chrome, Android and YouTube suite of products
has provided Google with unrivaled power to individually target you with ads
based on your online footprint.

For those troubled with Google's power and reach, this post will discuss the
[Brave browser](https://brave.com) and [DuckDuckGo
search](https://duckduckgo.com) products as viable alternatives to Google Chrome
and Google Search. Switching to these products will reduce your Google footprint
whilst also increasing your privacy and security.

Automatic Sign-in issue with Chrome
-----------------------------------

I was a long time user of Chrome, that being from launch in 2008 up until 2018.
I liked Chrome, it was fast, secure, extensible, and most importantly
cross-platform.

The inflection point when I soured on Chrome was when [Google accounts were
merged with Chrome sign-in](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17942252) in
Chrome 69. After that change, logging into your Google account, to read your
Gmail, for instance, would  also result in Chrome simultaneously signing-in to
Google. Presumably once Chrome is signed-in Google may synchronize, and
therefore track, your online activity without your consent, either now or in
the future.

I was not the only one upset by this particular change, Matthew Green, a
professor at Johns Hopkins University who teaches cryptography, [wrote about
the
issue](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome)
in depth.

Brave Browser
-------------

[Brave](https://brave.com) is a modern, privacy-focussed web browser that is
based on the same [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src)
browser and [Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink) rendering engine that powers
Google Chrome.

The Brave browser is [openly](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser) developed
by [Brave Software](https://github.com/brave) which was co-founded by Brendon
Eich, the creator of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and
co-founder of [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla), the organization
that makes [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox).

Notable privacy and security features of Brave:

- Automatically blocks unwanted content, such as tracking cookies and 3rd-party
  ads

- Automatically protects against
  [fingerprinting](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Fingerprinting-Protection-Mode)

- Where possible, insecure connections will be seamlessly be upgraded to
  encrypted connections for secure communication

- True private browsing mode via the [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) anonymity
  network

Similarities of Brave to Chrome:

- Equivalent look and feel

- Multi-platform support, including all major desktop and mobile platforms

- Cross-platform and cross-device
  [synchronization](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021218111-How-do-I-set-up-Sync-)

- Compatibility with all extensions in the [Chrome
  Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)

Notable Brave [deviations from
Chrome](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Deviations-from-Chromium-(features-we-disable-or-remove)):

- Google account synchronization is disabled

- All features that send data to Google are disabled

- Client-side cookie lifetimes are limited to 7 days

Whilst some privacy-focussed characteristics of Brave listed above are available
as browser extensions to Chrome, namely the [uBlock
Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) and [HTTPS
Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) extensions, be aware that not
all versions of Chrome support extensions, most frustratingly Chrome on mobile
devices. Also, content-filtering extensions, such as uBlock, run the risk of one
day being black-listed by Google. That will never be an issue for Brave since
its security and privacy protections are built-in to the browser itself.

Note, Brave is not the only Chromium-based browser available, other choices
include: [Opera](https://www.opera.com), [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com),
[Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) and now
even Microsoft's [Edge browser](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us).
Personally, I favour Brave above all these alternatives due to: open-source
development, native privacy and security features, timely updates,
cross-platform support and synchronization and lastly its resemblance to
Chrome.

Lastly, Brave has an excellent and easy to understand [privacy
policy](https://brave.com/privacy).

Recommended Brave Settings
--------------------------

Privacy and security can be enhanced by tweaking Brave's settings. Note, the
following settings were valid as of May 2019, however, there is no guarantee
they will be named the same, or even exist, going forward. 

Brave desktop-specific settings:

- `Search engine`, `Search engine used in the address bar`, change to
  `DuckDuckGo`

- `Brave Shields default`, `Fingerprintig protection` change to `Block
  all fingerprinting`

- `Social Buttons and Logins`, disable all choices

- `Privacy and security`, disable `Use a web service to help resolve navigation
  errors`, `Use a prediction service to load pages more quickly` and `Allow
  sites to check if you have payment methods saved`

- `Privacy and security`, change `WebRTC IP Handling Policy` to `Disable
  Non-Proxied UDP`

Brave mobile-specific settings:

- `Search engine`, change `Standard Tab` and `Private Tab` to `DuckDuckGo`

- `Privacy`, disable `Navigation error suggestions`, `Search and URL
  suggestions` and `Access payment methods`

DuckDuckGo
----------

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) is a privacy-focussed Internet search
engine.

Unlike Google Search, DuckDuckGo will:

- **Not** log user searches

- **Not** log user meta-data, such as your IP address

- **Not** track your online activity

- Display the same results, for a given search, to **all** users

The quality and relevance of search results from DuckDuckGo has greatly improved
over the last few years, hence, it no longer feels like a compromise to use
DuckDuckGo as compared to Google Search.

Much like Brave, DuckDuckGo also has an excellent and easy to understand
[privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy).

DuckDuckGo !Bangs
-----------------

DuckDuckGo Bangs are simple shortcuts to 3rd-party search sites. To invoke a
Bang search simply type `!` with the appropriate site code followed by the
search query.

Note, as of May 2019 there are over [12,000 Bangs
available](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) to use.

A few helpful DuckDuckGo Bangs:

- `!g search query`, [Google Search](https://www.google.com)

- `!gi search query`, [Goggle Images](https://images.google.com)

- `!gm search query`, [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)

- `!yt search query`, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)

- `!a search query`, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com)

- `!w search query`, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)

- `!e search query`, [eBay](https://www.ebay.com)

- `!r search query`, [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)

- `!gh search query`, [Github](https://www.github.com)

- `!so search query`, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

- `!t search query`, [Thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com)

- `!d search query`, [The Free Dictionary](https://www.thefreedictionary.com)

- `!rt search query`, [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com)

- `!bang search query` [DuckDuckGo Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang)

Bangs work particularly well in Brave once DuckDuckGo has been configured as the
default Search Engine; simply enter the Bang of choice and search query directly
in the address bar.

DuckDuckGo Bangs making searching the web easy, simple and fast.

DuckDuckGo Instant Answers

[DuckDuckGo Instant
Answers](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/features/instant-answers-and-other-features)
provides answers to searches, just below the search field, without need to click
any search results.

Conclusion
----------

The Web is now dominated by a few giant companies, chief among them Google. That
market concentration is not healthy, so it behooves us to sensibly diversify
where possible. Thankfully, with Brave and DuckDuckGo, as alternatives to Chrome
and Google Search respectively, diversifying will incur little compromise whilst
reaping genuine dividends, especially regarding privacy.

The more people that use products like Brave and DuckDuckGo, the healthier the
Web will be. Please give these alternatives a try :beers:
