Vim Tips (Revisited)
====================

A few years ago I posted about [Vim Tips &
Tricks](https://bluz71.github.io/2017/05/15/vim-tips-tricks.html) that I found
useful at the time. In the interim, certain new tips have been added to my
toolbox.

Now feels like the right time to revisit this topic. Be aware, there will be
some overlap between the old and new posts, but there are enough new tips that
will make this article worthwhile.

As per usual, I claim no authorship over these tips, just pure collation over my
Vim journey. It should also be noted, these tips are agnostic, they will work
with any modern version of Vim or Neovim (emphasis on **modern**).

Note, these and other tips are housed in my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/bluz71/dotfiles), if that is of interest.

Multiple Leader Keys & Group Similar Actions With The Same Prefix
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We all know about the Vim [leader
key](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/06.html#leader).
Some may even be aware of the [local leader
key](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/06.html#local-leader).

As time has gone by I have come to the conclusion that just one, maybe two,
leader keys is not enough. Instead I now advocate the use of multiple key map
prefixes and to group like operations under the same prefix.

In my case I now use four prefix keys for my personal mappings (aka leaders):

- `,` prefix for all windowing operation mappings (splits, tabs, switching, file drawer
  etc)

- `<Space>` prefix for fuzzy finding operation mappings (files, buffers, helptags etc)

- `'` prefix for plugin operation mappings (running tests, easy motions etc)

- `\` prefix for my [find and replace
  helpers](https://bluz71.github.io/2019/03/11/find-replace-helpers-for-vim.html)

Life is now a lot simpler, even though it seems more complicated. The grouping
of similar operations under the same prefix has greatly helped with mapping
recall.

Persistent Undo
---------------

Vim has had persistent undo capability since version 7.3.

However, by default, Vim does not enable persistent undo meaning change history
will only be saved for the active buffer, changing to another file results in
change history starting from scratch even when navigating back to the original
file. This is how one can lose *undos*.

Persistent undo remedies this issue by saving change history to disk.
Navigating between files or even exiting and returning to Vim will reference
these *saved* change histories allowing undo and redo to naturally work as one
would expect.

I favour saving these changes to fast temporary storage which means change
history will only be saved for the uptime of the workstation, which in my case
is all I need.

Add this snippet to your *vimrc:*

```viml
let s:undodir = "/tmp/.undodir_" . $USER
if !isdirectory(s:undodir)
    call mkdir(s:undodir, "", 0700)
endif
let &undodir=s:undodir
set undofile
```

The above configuration will store Vim change histories in a private
subdirectory of  `/tmp`, which on modern Linux workstations is carved from RAM.
If one desires to persist *undos* across reboots then please replace `/tmp` with
a directory in your home, for example `$HOME/.vim/undodir`. Note, in the latter
case you may need to periodically clean the undo directory since it will
accumulate changes forever.

Incrementing and decrementing
-----------------------------

Vim provides the useful `ctrl-a` and `ctrl-x` commands to increment and
decrement numbers.

In normal mode, entering `ctrl-a` will increment the first number to the right
of the cursor on the current line. Preceded by a count `ctrl-a` will increment
by the count amount. The `ctrl-x` command will do the reverse operation of
decrementing.

Personally, I don't like increment and decrement to take octal and hex
numbers into account, I prefer an increment on `07` to result in `08` and not
`010`.

Blanking the `nrformats` option will force decimal-based arithmetic.

```viml
set nrformats=
```

Mapping the `+` and `-` keys to increment and decrement feels more natural than
using the `ctrl` based defaults.

```viml
nnoremap + <C-a>
nnoremap - <C-x>
```

Simply hit `+` or `-` to adjust numbers on the current line.

A very useful Vim increment capability is the `g ctrl-a` command which can
increment a sequence of numbers in a vertical visual selection.

Say for example you have the following three lines in a visual selection (aka
using `ctrl-v` block selection).

```
0
0
0
```

Entering `g ctrl-a` will result in:

```
1
2
3
```

Prepending a count to the `g ctrl-a` command will determine the step size of
the increments. The `g ctrl-x` command will decrement instead of increment.

Again, I like to use `+` and `-` instead of `ctrl-a` and `ctrl-x`, hence I
use these mappings instead for visual sequence increment and decrement.

```viml
xnoremap + g<C-a>
xnoremap - g<C-x>
```

Wrapping with *breakindent*
---------------------------

The `breakindent` indent option is an excellent way to wrap long code lines.
When set, long lines will wrap *with* an indentation thus preserving the clean
indented look of code.

Set the following options to wrap long lines with indentation.

```viml
set breakindent
set breakindentopt=shift:2
set showbreak=\\\\\
```

When using a modern font, such as
[Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/iosevka), then I recommend using a
bent-arrow glyph as the `showbreak`.

```viml
set showbreak=â†³
```

Smarter *j* and *k* navigation
------------------------------

When any form of wrapping is in effect, I recommend `breakindent` as noted
above, then it is natural to convert the **j** and **k** movement commands from
strict linewise movements to onscreen display line movements via the **gj** and
**gk** commands. However, when preceded with a count, useful when
`relativenumber` is in effect, then we *want* to go back to strict linewise
movements.

The following mapping achieves both aims, display line movements unless
preceded by a count whilst also recording jump points for movements larger than
five lines:

```viml
nnoremap <expr> j v:count ? (v:count > 5 ? "m'" . v:count : '') . 'j' : 'gj'
nnoremap <expr> k v:count ? (v:count > 5 ? "m'" . v:count : '') . 'k' : 'gk'
```

Fast previous buffer switching
------------------------------

Hit `Control-6` to switch to the previously edited buffer, and hit `Control-6`
again to switch forward to the original buffer. Handy.

However I find `Control-6` awkward, I prefer **Backspace** to toggle between the
last two buffers since the key itself has an arrow pointing backward, like a
browser back button.

```viml
nnoremap <Backspace> <C-^>
```

When navigating, center the cursor
----------------------------------

I am a big fan of the `zz` center command. I find it more relaxing to edit when
the cursor is centered. So I sprinkle centering to as many navigation operations
as I can.

```viml
nnoremap {  {zz
nnoremap }  }zz
nnoremap n  nzz
nnoremap N  Nzz
nnoremap ]c ]czz
nnoremap [c [czz
nnoremap [j <C-o>zz
nnoremap ]j <C-i>zz
nnoremap ]s ]szz
nnoremap [s [szz
```

Go to the other end of a visual selection
----------------------------------------

Hit `o` to go to the other of the current visual selection, for example if you
wish to extend the visual selection (at the other end). This works for all types
of visual selection, including line and block selections.

Substitute in a visual block
----------------------------

Do the following to substitute *old* with *new* only within a rectangular
visual block, that being a `Control-v` style visual selection.

```
:'<,'>s/\%Vold/new
```

Make dot work over visual line selections
-----------------------------------------

By default, the **.** repeat operator does not work on visual selections.

Add this mapping in your *vimrc* file to enable a simple form of dot repetition
over visual line selections.

```viml
xnoremap . :norm.<CR>
```

It is recommended that only simple operations that start from the beginning of
a line be dot repeated. For example `ct=` (change up until =) or `5dw`
(delete the first five words of the line) are good candidates for visual dot
repetition.

Execute a macro over visual line selections
-------------------------------------------

Somewhat related to the previous tip is having the ability to run a macro only
over a visual line selection.

I use the `qq` command to record a macro into the *q register*. I then setup
the following `Q` mapping:

```viml
xnoremap Q :'<,'>:normal @q<CR>
```

Typing `Q` with a visual line selection in effect will execute the `q` macro
over just the selected lines.

Redirect change operations to the blackhole
-------------------------------------------

The unnamed register is quite fragile. I often found when I wanted to paste from
the unnamed register the content I wanted had frustratingly been overwritten.
Change operations being a prime culprit in overwriting the unnamed register.

Life for me is much better now that all change operations are directed to the
black hole register.

```viml
nnoremap c "_c
nnoremap C "_C
```

Clone current paragraph
-----------------------

I find this copy/clone paragraph mapping surprisingly useful.

```viml
nnoremap cp yap<S-}>p
```

Insert mode clipboard pasting
-----------------------------

`Control-v` is a common system level shortcut to paste from the clipboard. So
why not use it also to paste from the system clipboard when in insert mode.

```viml
inoremap <C-v> <C-r>*
```

Automatically equalize splits when Vim is resized
-------------------------------------------------

It is an annoyance to manually equalize Vim splits that have been munged by some
type of resize event, for example zooming in and out a *tmux* pane.

The following `autocmd` will take care of split equalization for you.

```
autocmd VimResized * wincmd =
```

Signs in the number column
--------------------------

Many years ago I never used the `signcolumn`. Then linting and language server
protocol became a part of my workflow, hence the `signcolumn` became a
necessity. However, I was never happy with the styling choices available; either
have the `signcolumn` permanently open, thereby losing two or more characters of
horizontal real estate, or have the `signcolumn` automatically open if in use,
which would result in a jarring sideways shift as the `signcolumn` came into and
out of existence (when linting that would happen often).

Nowadays I use the recent `set signcolumn=number` option which places signs over
the top of line numbers. Some line numbers will be sacrificed, in preference to
signs, but I honestly find it not that big a loss. I do like the compactness of
this setting, there is no screen real estate loss, nor any sideways jank.
However, I concede this option will not be for everyone, especially those who
like relative line numbers.
